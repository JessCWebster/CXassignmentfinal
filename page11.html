                    ROI and CX</h1>
                
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Return on investment (ROI) is a measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment. It measures the cost of the investment compared to the gain from the investment, and is expressed as a percentage ratio <a href="page7.html">(Staff, 2018)</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ROI = (Gain - Cost) 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cost 
<br>
<br>To understand how this is relevant in terms of customer experience (CX) we need to look at customer acquisition costs (CAC), customer retention costs (CRC) and customer lifetime value (CLV). 
<br>
<br>CAC is the amount of money or investment a business must spend in order to gain a transaction from a single customer. CRC is the amount of money or investment that a business must spend in order to retain a single customer’s business, and would fall under the ‘cost’ category when calculating ROI <a href="page7.html">(Optimove, 2018)</a>. 
<br>
<br>Min et al.<a href="page7.html"> (2016)</a> have found that CAC is more susceptible to market competition than CRC, and that CRCs are overall lower than CACs. Therefore retaining a customer rather than acquiring new customers will reduce the ‘cost’ of investment, when calculating ROI. 
<br>
<br>CRC is the opposite of CLV. CLV is a measure that estimates the value of all future profits gained from a customer.<a href="page7.html"> (Bayanjargal, Davaasuren and Enkhbat, 2018)</a>. This value stipulates that a long-term relationship with the business exists – in other words, this is based on the same customer returning to a business over their lifetime. CLV would fall under the ‘gain’ category when calculating ROI. 
<br>
<br>Therefore, ROI in terms of CX could be calculated like this: 
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CLV - CRC 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CRC 
<br>
<br>CX is important in this context. Kris <a href="page7.html">(2014) </a>found that customers who have the poorest experience using a company have a 43% chance of remaining a customer after a year, while customers who have a positive experience have a 74% chance of remaining a customer after a year. Kris <a href="page7.html">(2014)</a> has also found that delivering good CX reduces the cost of serving customers, as unhappy customers are more likely to require support or return products.
<br>
<br>It is therefore reasonable to suggest that positive CX will increase CLV and decrease CRC, therefore increasing ROI.&nbsp;</p>
