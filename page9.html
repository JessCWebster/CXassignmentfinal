                    Customer experience in IAS</h1>
                
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><br>Independent Assessment Services (IAS) has a primary business focus – to retain the annual contract to provide personal independence payment (PIP) assessments for the department of work and pensions (DWP). 
<br>
<br>There are many <a href="page10.html">stakeholders</a> involved in adopting CX for IAS. The staff who conduct the PIP assessments are health professionals (HPs). The service users in this context are the PIP claimants. When looking at CX and how it can impact the strategy of IAS, it is possible to view either the DWP, the HP or the claimant as the customer group, as each of their experiences will impact on <a href="page11.html">customer retention</a> and the eventual decision to renew the contract. <br>
<br>For this reason, improving the overall CX for any one customer group would require a multifaceted approach – the positive CX of the HP group would improve staff retention, leading to better quality of reports and increased productivity. This would in turn improve the CX of the claimant, as their point of contact – the HP – would be more competent, leading to reduced complaints and fewer appeals against the claim outcome. This in turn would improve the CX of the DWP as their perception of IAS as a supplier would improve and there would be less negative public perception of both IAS and the DWP, making them more likely to renew the contract. &nbsp;<br><br>Bruce Temkin <a href="page7.html">(2017, 2018)</a> has gained some insights on how CX impacts on customer retention;&nbsp;<br><br><a href="page7.html">Image 3</a></p>

                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">While claimant recommendations do not apply in this system as the assessment provider is decided based on the claimant’s location, HPs may recommend IAS as a place to work based on positive CX. Temkin <a href="page7.html">(2017)</a> found that customers are increasingly likely to share feedback over social media as time goes on, and found that a bad experience will cost money and is more likely to be shared by a customer<a href="page7.html"> (Temkin, 2018)</a>. <br><br>This is applicable in terms of the PIP contract; – social media feedback influences the general public’s perception of IAS, HPs and, by proxy, the DWP. <br><br>Feedback from claimants influences the HP’s CX as the company they work for and their own role is generally better or worse perceived and more or less reputable. It impacts the future claimant CX as their expectations of their PIP journey are better or worse. Finally, this influences part of the DWP’s CX and is likely to impact on their decision to renew the contract. <br>
<br>Therefore, if IAS choose to focus more on CX of these three groups and adopt this into their business strategy they are more likely to achieve their business goal. <br></p>
